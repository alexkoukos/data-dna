> Pyli is the gate that every AI tool in the company goes through: it finds which AI tools are used, catches sensitive data before it leaves (even when rewritten), and decides per prompt: allow, warn, mask, answer with a local model, or block.

Netcompany Hackathon Athens 2026, Challenge 3: Shadow AI protection and Data Protection.

## Concept
_To be written (R1). Source: docs/IDEA_AND_TEAM.md._

## Main features
_To be written (R1)._

## Setup and run
Requirements: Docker with Compose v2, about 2 GB of free RAM for Docker, and ports 3000, 4000 and 8001 free.

Measured on macOS Apple silicon (arm64, OrbStack, fresh clone, no build cache, 13 Nov 2026):

| What | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Build from scratch (`docker compose build --no-cache`) | 72 s |
| Start until all four services are healthy | 48 s |
| RAM when idle (web, gateway, brain, database) | about 770 MB (gateway 658, brain 70, database 34, web 9) |
| Web (3000) and API docs (8001) answer | yes, HTTP 200 |

Linux and Windows (WSL 2) are not measured yet.

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd data-dna
cp .env.example .env        # optional: add OPENAI_API_KEY
docker compose up --build
```
Open http://localhost:3000 (app) and http://localhost:8001/docs (API).

## Architecture
_Diagram and services table (R1). Source: docs/PRD.md section 7._

## Evaluation
_Results from `make eval` (E1)._

## Privacy and governance
_GDPR and EU AI Act (T5)._

## Known limits
_To be written._

## Roadmap
_From docs/business (T5)._
